**Renewed Vision PVP 3.1**

Go over to [Renewed Vision](https://renewedvision.com/provideoplayer/) to learn more about the software.

ProVideoPlayer (PVP) is a Mac-based software application designed to play back and manipulate video across one or more screens.
ProVideoPlayer (PVP)

For over a decade, productions and installations have used ProVideoPlayer for playback to one or more screens along with other tools as part of the full rig: ProPresenter for text and CG, a video rig for camera shots and live produced content, and an expensive screen control system to pull it all together. For many events, a lot of powerful and expensive equipment is radically under-utilized, so we set out to see if we could make a single product that would provide the tools needed for many productions when the complexity of more expensive solutions is unnecessary. That is the vision realized with PVP3.
